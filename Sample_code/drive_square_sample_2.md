## Basic Example of a Node that Executes a Task over a Sequence of Steps

This code provides a specific way to architect code that executes a task consisting of a sequence of steps (in this case driving a square).  This can be improved in many ways, so let me know what you think could be done to make it cleaner.

This code is also in the Github repo on [class_activities_and_resources](https://github.com/comprobo24/class_activities_and_resources).
