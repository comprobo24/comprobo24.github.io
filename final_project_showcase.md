## Final Project Showcase 2024

The [final project](/assignments/final_project.md) is an open-ended module for students to explore algorithms or applications of their interest. The final project is 3-4 weeks in duration, and student teams are asked to develop a demonstration of their work, a project portfolio, and ethics statement. During the 2024 version of this class, the following projects were completed:

* [Chess-Bot](https://moricantdraw.github.io/ChessbotWebsite/) -- a Widow X arm is programmed to play chess against a human player in real-time. Topic keywords: manipulators, kinematics, game play, search algorithms, visual change detection, human-robot interface

* [Fleet Robotics](https://itannermahncke.github.io/fleet_robotics/) -- multiple Neatos are launched simultaneously with unique navigational goals in an environment, and must coordinate (in a decentralized manner) to successfully execute their missions. Top keywords: decentralized planning, state estimation, ROS2 launch and parameters, visual odometry, priority queuing, shortest-path 

* [Neato Temple Runner](https://arib2003.github.io/neato_temple_run/rviz.html) -- a Neato must navigate around an unknown space as quickly as possible, generating random waypoints and avoiding obstacles. Topic keywords: RRT, occupancy grids, monocular depth estimation, receding horizon path planning, nonmyopic planning, ROS visualization
