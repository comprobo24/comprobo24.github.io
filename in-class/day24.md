## Kalman Filter

We'll be running through this slide deck ([pptx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yVFgAFPqXGgN2F0FlHZPxA7lYgJlGYPF/view?usp=sharing), [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vtcSzF_Q7o6PEhUoXCoIfLgYFX_Xs4-_/view?usp=sharing))

Once we've given you the basic ideas, we'll also show you how to run your own simple Kalman filter.  The commands to run the filter are.


First, startup roscore.

```bash
$ roscore
```

In a new terminal, run the following command.
 
```bash
$ rosrun simple_filter simple_kalman.py
```

In a new terminal, run the following command.
```bash
$ rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui
```

In the ``rqt_gui`` window, go to ``plugins``, ``Visualization``, ``Dynamic Reconfigure``.  You should now have a window that looks like this.

You can use these sliders to control the behavior of the filter.
