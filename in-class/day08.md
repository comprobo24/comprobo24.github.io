*** UNDER CONSTRUCTION ***

## Today

We'll be talking about the theory of the Bayesian filter and how it relates to the particle filter algorithm.

## For Next Time

* [Readings for discussion on Robotics and Labor](https://olin.instructure.com/courses/592/assignments/10724)
* Work on the [Robot Localization project](../assignments/robot_localization).


## Bayesian Filtering and the Particle Filter

* [Notes from Today on Bayes' filter](updated_bayes_filter.pdf)

I will lead a walkthrough of the derivation in-class.  You are welcome to hangout in the room and listen (and hopefully ask questions).  Once I go over some framing you can leave and work through this with friends..

### Proposed Model for Working through this Derivation

With your partner and another team, work through the notes.  Here are some guidelines.

* Make sure everyone understands each step before moving onto the next one.
* If there is a persistent issue that cannot be resolved, call a member of the teaching team over and ask us for help.  If for some reason this is not easy to do at the time, make a note of it so you can return to it later.
* If you need more help at any point in the derivation, don't hesitate to call a member of the teaching team over and ask for help.
* Stop when you get to the question about scalability.
