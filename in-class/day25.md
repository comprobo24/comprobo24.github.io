## Labor and Automation Debrief
We've had several conversations over the last weeks on labor and automation. Today, let's meta-reflect together on some of your answers to the individual prompts from the last few classes:

* What are your preconceptions about automation and labor? What questions do you have about automated labor?
* When is automating a market justified?
* How does intelligence differ from autonomy, and when is intelligence justified for development? 
* How should an engineer define, navigate, and assess social requirements and impacts on a technical system? What conversations are key to have during the design and implementation phases?

In particular, in your small groups, discuss:

* Whether there were any surprises or challenges to your preconceptions in these discussions.
* What questions remain for you with respect to automated labor.
* How understanding market and labor drivers impacts how you view robotics or robotics careers, if at all.
