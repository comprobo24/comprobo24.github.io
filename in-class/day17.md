## Broader Impacts Discussions
Today, some folks will be leading discussions on their broader impacts robots ([discussion leaders noted here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t2wJVq1ryEH47zOyPqVHE0VHtDHGa2fm6ehskNi13aA/edit?usp=sharing)). 

> Discussants: Please choose a table / area of the room (or outside of the room!) for your discussion, and let the instructors know if there are any materials you'd like to have available for your discussion. A discussion slot will be ~25 minutes in length total; you will be signalled after 10 minutes (when you should be transitioning from presentation to discussion), and at the 5 minute warning.

> Participants: At the end of the discussion slot, please fill in [this reaction survey](https://forms.gle/8iwFzQXmtbPA8cCWA). Your responses will be available to the teaching team and to discussants afterwards.

We'll have a brief debrief following the activity and before starting in on Studio time.
