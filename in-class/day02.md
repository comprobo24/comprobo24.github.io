## First Day Debrief
Thanks everyone for filling in the <a href="https://forms.gle/1SPkoxWMQSQn3Ci16">course entrance survey</a>; we really appreciate your feedback so far and will announce consistent office hours early this week based on the results. Some key things that came up during the survey to share with you all:
* **What's Exciting** -- open-ended project structures, learning topics that are broadly applicable to different robotic systems, software development, leveraging the class to learn more about E:Robo majoring or longer-term career aspirations
* **What's Concerning** -- developing appropriate project scopes, translating concepts to projects in a meaningful way, previous experience with software development translating to this class
  * The teaching team is here to help with project formulation, as much as helping execute on projects. There is flexibility built into the Machine Vision and Final Projects to also re-adjust goals partway through projects if scoping needs to change for whatever reason.
  * The hopeful goal of the State Estimation and Localization project is to demonstrate how to take some mathematical and computational concepts in robotics, and translate them to our specific Neato platforms. This "translation scaffolding" combined with in-class coding exercises throughout the semester, is designed to assist with concept-to-application in projects. 
  * The Warm-up phase of the course is an opportunity for everyone to start experimenting with the software tools we have in the class, and in-class activities will be heavily oriented around building good software practice. Now is a great time to come to office hours or reach out to the teaching team if there are particular areas in software development that you are looking to improve upon before we start kicking off some of our algorithms work. 
* **Exposure to Robotics** -- for many folks robotics is a new area of exploration even if they have had significant software experience previously, other folks may have intersected with robotics in high school through team projects or have completed robotics or robotics-adjacent projects during other courses.
  * We can and should lean on each other in this class -- if you feel strong in your background, share with others! If you're learning and have questions, chat with your colleagues in this class! This is a nice opportunity for everyone to teach and learn across the different facets of the class.
* **Broader Impacts Themes** -- far and away _Job Automation and Workforce Impacts_ were a theme highlighted by you all for particular exploration in this class. Other popular themes included _Security/Surveillance and Privacy_, _Sustainability_, _Designing for Intended Use_, and _Research and Venture Funding for Robotics_. We will take these themes and integrate them into our topical themes for each unit, and we encourage you to consider the themes you might be personally interested in for your Broader Impacts assignment.
* **Lingering Questions** -- will this course cover or use some ML topics? how does this course set the foundation for other courses in the curriculum?
  * ML is a huge umbrella of topics, and we will definitely be touching on some in this class -- particularly during the Machine Vision module, as well as some topics I'd like to lightly cover during the Final Project phase of the class. Folks interested in getting more ML should reach out to the teaching team, and we can discuss how to build a toolkit you can use for this class beyond what's already intended.
  * This class aims to serve as a foundation that can be carried forward into other E:Robo, E:C, and ECE advanced elective topics, particularly (in the Olin curriculum): RoboSys, SoftSys, CompArch, ML, Controls, Data structures and Algorithms, and Elecanisms. This class can also be a complement to, or complemented by, classes (in the Olin curriculum): Eclectronics, Principles of Wireless Communication, Data Science, Computational Bayesian Statistics, Introduction to Analog and Digital Communication, Digital Signal Processing, and Technology, Accessibility, and Design. Software development skills, a focus on software integration into hardware systems, and an introduction to computational challenges through the lens of robotics, are the skills you can expect to build in this class and carry forward to others.      
* **Peer Goals** -- shared themes among people in the class include an interest in understanding the intersection of programming and hardware, learning more about what "robots" are and what skills are involved in working with them, considering the E:Robo pathway or alternatives, considering a pathway in robotics as a career.
  * Something we absolutely want to support in this class are conversations about career prep (curricular strategy, crafting useful projects, pointing to more skill resources, introducing the landscape of post-grad opportunities, etc.) as they might be related to robotics, robotic-software, or robotics-adjacent interests. Please feel free to investigate these topics through your projects and discuss with colleagues and the teaching team in-class, on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rD7nREsv), or at office hours!

## About Modern Robotics: A Glossary
"Robotics" as a field of study or industry encompasses a _huge_ range of topics, themes, and systems. To be a roboticist in practice is to be someone who can appreciate the complexity of sociotechnical systems, can collaborate with domain experts across various technical / applied fields, and who generally specializes in a particular facet of a robotic system.

Here is a brief tour of terms used to describe various facets of the field of robotics and resources to learn more! [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aNEeU3ItobY0l_ijuL2yFherPyzIpnMNhX3B_KoYxxQ/edit?usp=sharing)


## Coding Exercises: Writing our first ROS Node

Sample solutions for these exercises can be found in the [class_activities_and_resources Github repo](https://github.com/comprobo24/class_activities_and_resources).  If you'd like to organize your class work as a GitHub repo, we suggest you fork the repo ``class_activities_and_resources``.

### Creating a ROS package

Let's write our code today in a package called ``in_class_day02``

```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/class_activities_and_resources
$ ros2 pkg create in_class_day02 --build-type ament_python --node-name send_message --dependencies rclpy std_msgs geometry_msgs sensor_msgs
```

This command will create a Python package for you (indicated by `--build-type ament_python`) and a node called ``send_message`` that will leverage `rclpy` and `std_msgs`, `geometry_msgs`, and `sensor_msgs` utilities. The node should be located in the following location:

```bash
~/ros2_ws/src/class_activities_and_resources/in_class_day02/in_class_day02/send_message.py
```

By default it will look like this:

```python
def main():
    print('Hi from in_class_day02.')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

### Building and Running your Node

You can build your node by running:

```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ colcon build --symlink-install
```

What's going on in this command? [Colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) is a build system wrapper designed for ROS workspaces. A workspace is a collection of software packages and their build/log/install artifacts for a system. A build system compiles software packages (typically located in the `\src` folder of a workspace) and creates those build/log/install artifacts that ultimately lets a software package run on a machine. Colcon is a convenience wrapper for ROS that can deal with Python, C++/C, and mixed-compilation packages that are common in robotics projects. If you want to learn more about legacy systems, you might be interested in [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces), [cmake](https://cmake.org/), and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

What does ``--symlink-install`` do?  A [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) is a special type of file that points to another file.  In this case we will have a special file in our ``install`` directory that points to our Python script in our ``src`` directory.  In this way, we can modify the Python script ``send_message.py`` and run the modified ROS node without constantly running ``colcon build``.  To see the symlink run the following command.

```bash
$ ls -l ~/ros2_ws/build/in_class_day02/in_class_day02

lrwxrwxrwx 1 parallels parallels 108 Sep  5 20:14 /home/parallels/ros2_ws/build/in_class_day02/in_class_day02 -> /home/parallels/ros2_ws/src/class_activities_and_resources/in_class_day02/in_class_day02
```
Notice how the ``->`` sign indicates a pointer (symlink) from the ``build`` directory back to the ``src`` directory. From the perspective of rapid prototyping, this is one advantage of using languages like Python that don't require compilation in order to run. If we were writing nodes in C++/C, we would need to re-build our project every time we made an edit.

In order to run the node, first [source](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/linux-101-what-does-sourcing-a-file-mean-in-linux/) the ``install.bash`` script and then use ``ros2 run`` (Hint: try using tab completion when typing in the package and node names)
```bash
$ source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
$ ros2 run in_class_day02 send_message
```
Sourcing is a bash command that lets an executable use references located specially within a script (for instance, system variables, system pointers, background processes, etc. can be defined and deployed in a script). If you did not source your `setup.bash` after making changes, then you will likely encounter an error that prevents you from running your node (try it out by making a modification to a package and not sourcing sometime, so you can see what the error might look like!).

### Creating a Skeleton ROS Node

In order for your Python program to interface with ROS, you have to call the appropriate functions.  The easiest way to do this is by creating a subclass of the ``rclpy.node.Node`` class ([Documentation on rclpy](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/rclpy/api/node.html) will likely be helpful to familiarize yourself with!). If you are a bit rusty on your Python object-oriented concepts, take a look back at your notes from SoftDes (also let us know if you have a favorite resource for this). Taking the code that was automatically created in the ``ros2 pkg`` step and converting it into a ROS node, would look like this:

```python
""" This script explores publishing ROS messages in ROS using Python """
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class SendMessageNode(Node):
    """This is a message publishing node, which inherits from the rclpy Node class."""
    def __init__(self):
        """Initializes the SendMessageNode. No inputs."""
        super().__init__('send_message_node')
        # Create a timer that fires ten times per second
        timer_period = 0.1
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.run_loop)

    def run_loop(self):
        """Prints a message to the terminal."""
        print('Hi from in_class_day02.')

def main(args=None):
    """Initializes a node, runs it, and cleans up after termination.
    Input: args(list) -- list of arguments to pass into rclpy. Default None.
    """
    rclpy.init(args=args)      # Initialize communication with ROS
    node = SendMessageNode()   # Create our Node
    rclpy.spin(node)           # Run the Node until ready to shutdown
    rclpy.shutdown()           # cleanup

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

As before, you can run the node using ``ros2 run``

```bash
$ ros2 run in_class_day02 send_message
```

You will now have to use ``ctrl-c`` to stop execution of your node.  You should see the string ``Hi from in_class_day02`` print repeatedly onto the console.

### Creating ROS Messages in a Python Program

ROS messages are represented in Python as objects.  In order to create a ROS message you must call the ``__init__`` method for the ROS message class.  As an example, suppose we want to create a ROS message of type ``geometry_msgs/msg/PointStamped``.  The first thing we need to do is import the Python module that defines the ``PointStamped`` class.  The message type ``geometry_msgs/msg/PointStamped`` indicates that the ``PointStamped`` message type is part of the ``geometry_msgs`` package.  All of the definitions for messages stored in the ``geometry_msgs`` package will be in a sub-package called ``geometry_msgs.msg``.  In order to import the correct class definition into our Python code, we can create a new Python script at ``~/ros2_ws/src/class_activities_and_resources/in_class_day02/in_class_day02/send_message.py`` and add the following line to the top of our ``send_message.py`` script.

```python
from geometry_msgs.msg import PointStamped
```

Now we will want to create a message of type PointStamped.  In order to do this, we must determine what attributes the PointStamped object contains.  In order to do this, run

```bash
$ ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/PointStamped
# This represents a Point with reference coordinate frame and timestamp

std_msgs/Header header
	builtin_interfaces/Time stamp
		int32 sec
		uint32 nanosec
	string frame_id
Point point
	float64 x
	float64 y
	float64 z
```

If we look at the lines that are unindented (aligned all the way to the left), we will see the attributes that comprise a ``PointStamped`` object.  These attributes are header (which is of type ``std_msgs/msg/Header``) and point (which is of type ``geometry_msgs/msg/Point``).  The indented lines define the definition of the ``std_msgs/msg/Header`` and ``geometry_msgs/msg/Point`` messages.  To see this, try doing running ``$ ros2 interface show`` for both ``std_msgs/msg/Header`` and ``geometry_msgs/msg/Point``.

In order to create the PointStamped object, we will have to specify both a ``std_msgs/msg/Header`` and a ``geometry_msgs/msg/Point``.  Based on the definitions of these two types given by ``$ ros2 interface show`` (output omitted, but you can see it in a slightly different form above), we know that for the ``std_msgs/msg/Header`` message we need to specify seq, stamp, and frame_id. It will turn out that we don't have to worry about the ``seq`` (it will automatically be filled out by the ROS runtime when we publish our message), the stamp field is a ROS time object (see this tutorial), and the ``frame_id`` field is simply the name of the coordinate frame (more on coordinate frames later) in which the point is defined.  Likewise, the ``geometry_msgs/msg/Point`` object needs three floating point values representing the $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$ coordinates of a point.  We can create these two messages using the standard method of creating objects in Python.  In this example we will be using the keyword arguments form of calling a Python function which will make your code a bit more robust and a lot more readable.  First, we add the relevant import statements:

```python
from std_msgs.msg import Header
from geometry_msgs.msg import Point, PointStamped
```

Now we can define the header and point that will eventually compose our ``PointStamped`` message.  Let's put this code in the ``run_loop`` function so we can publish the message each time ``run_loop`` is called.

```python
my_header = Header(stamp=self.get_clock().now().to_msg(), frame_id="odom")
my_point = Point(x=1.0, y=2.0, z=0.0)
```

Now that we have the two fields required for our PointStamped message, we can create it.

```python
my_point_stamped = PointStamped(header=my_header, point=my_point)
```

To see what our resultant message looks like, we can print it out:

```python
print(my_point_stamped)
```

This will produce the output:

```bash
geometry_msgs.msg.PointStamped(header=std_msgs.msg.Header(stamp=builtin_interfaces.msg.Time(sec=1662424018, nanosec=755100091), frame_id='odom'), point=geometry_msgs.msg.Point(x=1.0, y=2.0, z=0.0))
```

> Note that instead of creating the two attributes of PointStamped in separate lines, we can do everything in one line as:
```python
my_point_stamped = PointStamped(header=Header(stamp=self.get_clock().now().to_msg(),
                                              frame_id="odom"),
                                point=Point(x=1.0, y=2.0, z=0.0))
```

In order to do something interesting, let's publish our message to a topic called ``/my_point``

First, we create the publisher in our ``__init__`` method by adding the following line to the end of that function.
```python
self.publisher = self.create_publisher(PointStamped, 'my_point', 10)
```

You can publish ``my_point_stamped`` by adding the following code to the end of your ``run_loop`` function

```python
self.publisher.publish(my_point_stamped)
```

Try running your code!

How can you be sure whether it is working or not?  Try visualizing the results in rviz.  What steps are needed to make this work?


### Callbacks

[Callback functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)) are a fundamental concept in ROS (and we just used them to create our timer whether we knew it or not).  Specifically, they are used to process incoming messages inside a ROS node once we have subscribed to a particular topic.  Let's write some code to listen to the message we created in the previous step.

First, let's create a new ROS node in a file called ``receive_message.py`` in the directory ``~/ros2_ws/src/class_activities_and_resources/in_class_day02/in_class_day02``.  We'll start out with the standard first line as well as a header comment, import the correct message type, and initialize our ROS node:

```python
""" Investigate receiving a message using a callback function """
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from geometry_msgs.msg import PointStamped

class ReceiveMessageNode(Node):
    """This is a message subscription node, which inherits from the rclpy Node class."""
    def __init__(self):
        """Initializes the ReceiveMessageNode. No inputs."""
        super().__init__('receive_message_node')

def main(args=None):
    """Initializes a node, runs it, and cleans up after termination.
    Input: args(list) -- list of arguments to pass into rclpy. Default None.
    """
    rclpy.init(args=args)         # Initialize communication with ROS
    node = ReceiveMessageNode()   # Create our Node
    rclpy.spin(node)              # Run the Node until ready to shutdown
    rclpy.shutdown()              # cleanup

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In order to run the node, we have to add it to our ``setup.py`` file, which is located in ``~/ros2_ws/src/class_activities_and_resources/in_class_day02/setup.py``.  We can modify the file as follows.

```python
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'send_message = in_class_day02_solutions.send_message:main',
            'receive_message = in_class_day02_solutions.receive_message:main',
        ],
    },
```

Once you've modified ``setup.py``, you'll need to do another ``colcon build``.

```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ colcon build --symlink-install
```

You can now run your node using the command:
```bash
$ ros2 run in_class_day02 receive_message
```

As of now, it won't do anything.

Next, we will define our callback function.  Our callback function takes as input a single parameter which will be a Python object of the type that is being published on the topic that we subscribe to.  Eventually we will be subscribing to the topic ``/my_point`` which means that we will be writing a callback function that handles objects of type ``geometry_msgs/PointStamped``.  As a test, let's make our callback function simply print out the header attribute of the PointStamped message.  This function should be added as a method of our ``ReceiveMessageNode`` class.

```python
def process_point(self, msg):
    """Takes msg input and prints the header of that message."""
    print(msg.header)
```

Next, we must subscribe to the appropriate topic by adding this line to the ``__init__`` method.

```python
self.sub = self.create_subscription(PointStamped, 'my_point', self.process_point, 10)
```

The ROS runtime will take care of calling our ``process_point`` function whenever a new message is ready!  There is nothing more we have to do to make this happen!

Go ahead and run your ROS node ``receive_message`` and see what happens!  (make sure your ``send_message`` node is also running)

### Viewing the Results in RViz

We can open up rviz and visualize the message.  First, open rviz.

```bash
$ rviz2
```

Next, click ``add``, ``by topic``, and select your marker message.  Make sure to set the ``fixed frame`` appropriately.
