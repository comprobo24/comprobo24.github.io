## Today
* Final Project Showcase
* Semester Debrief

## By The End of the Day
* Turn in the [Final Project](../assignments/final_project.md).
* Turn in your [YOGA Part 2](../assignments/class_yoga.md).
* Any outstanding work is welcome to be submitted; talk to an instructor if you have questions/concerns.
* Consider whether there is [feedback you'd like to share about the class](https://forms.gle/giCwA1pkr4y3e4T37)
   * I'd also appreciate if you filled out the official course survey from the Registrar's Office -- the results will be available to me and to anyone teaching CompRobo in the future, and it will help me be more effective in other classes as well. Thank you!

## Final Project Showcase
You all have poured time and energy into your final projects over the last weeks. Let's celebrate your learning! [Slides for today are found here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_YoLo1mzldFdT5M5Z56U12uOsLaCteA9yoaoNDyWK2Q/edit?usp=sharing)

## Semester Debrief
We've now come to the end of CompRobo. We'll take a little time for filling in feedback forms and submitting coursework, then have a chat to wrap up the semester.
