## Today
* Search and Rescue Wrap-Up
* Localization Project Share-Out and Demos
* Machine Vision Kick-Off 
* Studio Time

## For Next Time
* Turn in the [Robot Localization project](../assignments/robot_localization)
  * Code + Writeups due on **Friday October 18th 7PM**
* Read over the [Broader Impacts assignment Part 2](../assignments/broader_impacts), due on **November 5th at 7PM** 
  * Note -- discussions will happen on October 28th, October 31st, and November 4th; you have been [randomly assigned one of these days to lead a discussion](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t2wJVq1ryEH47zOyPqVHE0VHtDHGa2fm6ehskNi13aA/edit?usp=sharing). You may swap slots with someone on a different day, but you have to let an instructor know. Thanks!
* Read over the [Machine Vision Project Document](../assignments/computer_vision_project).
    * Project Proposal is due on **Tuesday October 22nd at 7PM**. We'll have some in-class time today and next time to discuss this further.
* Consider whether there is [feedback you'd like to share about the class](https://forms.gle/giCwA1pkr4y3e4T37)
* **Extra Credit** An assignment to [reinforce probability fundamentals](../assignments/probability_basics/assignmentprobability_basics.pdf) is available to complete for extra credit (to be applied to the state estimation and localization unit). Due on **Friday October 18th 7PM** for those interested; [check the Canvas page for submission instructions](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/822/assignments/13050).


## Search and Rescue Wrap-Up
As a bit of an experiment this module, we've had a broader impacts theme related to Search and Rescue we've been discussing. Some of the topics we covered included:
* Definition of Search and Rescue, and overview of the research-practice landscape
* Highlighting some algorithms used in Search and Rescue robotics today (SLAM, localization, etc.)
* Intended Use in programming
* Standards Setting and design practices

For this debrief, I'd like you to discuss in your small groups:
1. Is there anything we discussed about SAR robots that has stuck with you? Why or why not?
2. What remaining questions do you have about SAR robots?
3. What aspects of these discussions worked well for you? What would you like to change in future modules?

We'll have a brief share-out, but I'd also love to capture your feedback as we look towards the next modules. In your small groups, [you can capture your notes here](https://forms.gle/Tp1ncEeV2x8jHAyr5). 

## Localization Project Share-Out and Demos
You all have been working _hard_ on implementing and expanding upon a particle filter. Let's celebrate what's been learned, successes and failures, advice, funny stories, and more. A [shareout deck is available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U1gHBxwc8ghFjZHDhROF24qZ6cSJkepm7cPE1UAP1Yw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Machine Vision Kick-Off
Our kick-off discussion can be found in [this Google Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-o-3sEjfQml997eXZXBhzvSXdge1GZOplDOGS4IqfgE/edit?usp=sharing).
