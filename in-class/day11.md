*** UNDER CONSTRUCTION ***

## Today

* Particle Filter Debugging Strategies
* Extensions to the particle filter
* You will be working on your robot localization projects.
* We will have a brief visit from Eric Miller of Skydio to talk about what some of the themes of CompRobo look like in industry. 

## For Next Time

* Soft launch of computer vision project (Robot localization project will be due on Friday the 13th).

## Particle Filter Debugging Techinques

### Using Python Debugger ``pdb``

In order to use ``pdb`` you'll want to change your workflow a little bit.  Instead of launching your particle filter and the map server through the ``test_pf.py`` launch file, you will be starting the map server separately and then launching your particle filter through your Python IDE (e.g., VSCode).

You can start the ``map_server`` using the following command:

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
ros2 launch robot_localization launch_map_server.py map_yaml:=path-to-map-yaml 
```

If all went well, you will see the following output.

```bash
[INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /home/pruvolo/.ros/log/2022-10-07-11-30-28-273830-pruvolo-Precision-3551-7847

```

Now that the ``map_server`` is running, you can start the debugger through ``VSCode`` (as an example) by selecting ``Run`` and then ``Start with Debugging``.  Next, choose ``Python`` as your debugging configuration.  Make sure you have set the focus of ``VSCode`` to your ``pf.py`` script before doing this.  You can now set breakpoints or inspect your program's state in the event of a crash.

### Debugging Using Matplotlib

Sometimes it's easier to get a quick and dirty visualization going using a familiar tool like matplotlib.  You could consider using this for things like plotting particle weights or motion updates.

## Extensions to the Particle Filter

### Make your particle filter more efficient computationally

Advice:
* Find the critical path (what runs the most often and therefore what would give the biggest return on your investment of work).
* The ``OccupancyField`` class has support for processing multiple points simultaneously (vectors of $$(x,y)$$ coordinates).
* Matrix multiplication is your friend (how can a multiplication remove a loop?)
* Benchmark sections of your code by adding timers to see if your efforts are paying off.

### Experiment with laser scan likelihood functions

Advice:
* Look in the Probabilistic Robotics book to see read about ``z_hit``, ``z_random``, etc.

### Robot Kidnapping Problem

Advice:
* Make your code faster first (it will let you use more particles)
* You may need to come up with ways to initialize the particle cloud in smart ways
* Past comprobo projects may provide good clues (look at examples from the [localization assignment](../assignments/robot_localization)). 

### Connection Between the Particle Filter and the Bayes Filter

Advice:
* The core idea is this concept of sequential importance sampling (SIS).  The writeup of this are pretty technical, but you may start with this resource from [Columbia by Frank Wood](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~fwood/Tutorials/sequential_monte_carlo.pdf). You can also check out section 4.2 of the [Probabalistic Robotics book](https://docs.ufpr.br/~danielsantos/ProbabilisticRobotics.pdf).
