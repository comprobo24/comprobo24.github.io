## Today
* Machine Vision Showcase
* Project Ideation and Team formation for Final Project

## For Next Time
* Turn in your [Machine Vision Project](../assignments/computer_vision_project).
* Select a project topic and team, and start to work on the [Final Project Proposal](../assignments/final_project.md), due **Friday 15th at 1PM**. (We will be dedicating class time to this on Thursday).
    * Once you have a team, fill in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jNmGA6Lxs90oOHcQR8DOHVDKfWE9OdGI3tmLi_gVgD4/edit?usp=sharing).
    * _Individually_ complete [YOGA Phase 1](../assignments/class_yoga.md) by **Friday 15th at 7PM**.
* Read over and be aware of the expectations for the [Broader Impacts Part 3 Assignment](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/822/assignments/13047), due on **December 6th at 7PM**.
* Consider whether there is [feedback you'd like to share about the class](https://forms.gle/giCwA1pkr4y3e4T37)


## Machine Vision Showcase
The day has arrived -- the conclusion of our Machine Vision unit! We'll have a brief scene-setting overview of some of the key topics we've discussed this unit, then launch into the team demonstrations. You can follow along [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f9KytMYqokf92reDr2SoMoVND6-iOOvzHvws4b8aioA/edit?usp=sharing) (note -- this also contains the order for demonstrations).

## Final Project Ideation / Team Formation
Take a look at the [final project assignment document](../assignments/final_project) -- today we'll be forming teams, brainstorming project ideas, and starting your project proposals. Our process will be similar to the machine vision project proposal period, with several keys to keep in mind (see [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-srgsQDcJglhN-344Ak-MKjgBG1r_E6SnrH40IISyM8/edit?usp=sharing)):

* The project teams can be _up to 4 folks_ for this assignment
* There will be 8 class periods dedicated for this project (including this one) -- 4 in-class weeks + Thanksgiving week + the "final events" week
    * All the final materials for this project will be due **December 19th at 3PM** which is the conclusion of our Final Event block.
    * Beyond the typical demo + code + write-up, you are also asked to create a project portfolio website, a responsible use statement, and prepare two milestone check-ins for this project
* You are welcome to explore any topic(s) of interest for this project, building on your previous projects or projects in other classes (if building on projects from other classes, do be clear about this in your proposal)
* The project should very much focus on a _robotic system_ -- while I won't require integration with the Neatos specifically, use of datasets generated from real-platforms or use of other robots is highly encouraged.
    * An implication on this requirement is that most projects will be written as ROS packages.

Process:
* [5 min] Read through the [final project assignment document](../assignments/final_project) and individually review your learning goals for the class and for this project
* [10 min] Create a sticky-note for each topic/theme you'd like to explore in this project. Consider:
   * Is there a particular robotic system you'd like to investigate?
   * Is there a particular class of algorithm you'd like to learn about?
   * Is there a particular algorithm you'd like to implement or dataset you'd like to use?
* [10 min] Gather with 2 other folks and sort your sticky-notes into clusters on a white board -- label your clusters with themes of interest
* [5 min] Gallery walk the room and look at the affinity clusters that are being developed; what looks interesting to you?
* [8 min] Choose a theme that interests you and go to it in the room; with the other folks in that area, discuss your learning goals and ideas you have related to that theme
   * You're not committing to anything yet! This is about exploring some areas and project ideas of interest
* [8 min] Pick another theme and go to it; repeat your discussions
   * You're not committing to anything yet! This is about exploring some areas and project ideas of interest
* [8 min] Find some possible partners and begin to scope a project you'd like to complete. You can use the proposal guidelines to frame your discussion
* [Last 10 minutes] Rapid-fire project pitches -- volunteers will pitch a 30-second idea for a project to the group
