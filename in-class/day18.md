## Today
* CA Lecture: Visual Odometry and SLAM
* Studio Time

## For Next Time
* Work on your [Machine Vision Project](../assignments/computer_vision_project).
    * In-class demos will be on **Monday November 11th**, and code/write-ups are due on **Tuesday November 12th at 7PM**.
    * Note that prospective students will be joining us in class on the 11th!
* Consider whether there is [feedback you'd like to share about the class](https://forms.gle/giCwA1pkr4y3e4T37)

## Visual Odometry and SLAM
At the top of the class, Ayush will be presenting on _Visual Odometry and SLAM_ -- a machine vision extension of our discussions during the particle filter and localization module. You can see a [copy of his slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OoVaxgXpjtJDstO1JPc924h8EGrCS2tABfMj7DEiVYM/edit?usp=sharing).

Modern mobile robotics today is significantly underpinned by visual sensing and downstream tasks like odometry/localization, mapping, SLAM, image segmentation, and more. If you'd like to learn more, some resources to get started:

* Read up on papers by academics like:
    * Nicholas Roy and the Robust Robotics Group (e.g., [Visual Odometry and Mapping for Autonomous Flight Using an RGB-D Camera](http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/aiweb/media/papers/Huang-ISRR-2011.pdf))
    * Davide Scaramuzza (e.g., [SVO: Fast Semi-Direct Monocular Visual Odometry](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/125453/1/ICRA14_Forster.pdf))
* Check out some of these explainers:
    * [Visual SLAM tutorial](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096039&casa_token=7sM1LlBYhmEAAAAA:aEFQyL7n_g0YfqexZqduZf8Ia49KlmOXvncNygpwo9TjW0JRkvTsbKtq8c-3r8Ih7OYlLWI22WQ) by Scaramuzza and Fraundorfer
    * [A From Scratch](https://avisingh599.github.io/vision/visual-odometry-full/) blog post
    * [Papers and tutorials from ETH Zurich](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/rpg/research/research_vo.html)
    * [MatLab's Explainer + Code](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/monocular-visual-odometry.html)
    * [An Explainer with Python/OpenCV Code](https://johnwlambert.github.io/vo/)
* Try out some code
    * [RTAB-Map's Project Page](http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/)
    * Open-source Github projects, [like this](https://github.com/alishobeiri/Monocular-Video-Odometery)
