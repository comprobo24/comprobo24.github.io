## Pinhole Camera Model 

The slides for today are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/183hd5G-3i9NTpyTNFtQoUngpGFm1sggn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111620635148858770174&rtpof=true&sd=true).  I won't be lecturing on these, but please go through them on your own if you'd like (and I'm here to answer questions).

## Camera Calibration Resources

Here is a tutorial on [how to do camera calibration in ROS2](https://navigation.ros.org/tutorials/docs/camera_calibration.html)

Note that you'll need checkerboards!
