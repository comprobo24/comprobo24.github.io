## The Automated Labor Landscape
_Automated labor_ refers to the process of replacing manually completed actions with technology. While it has colloquially often referred to using machinery to replace physical labor, it is increasingly used to refer to the automation of less physically-intensive tasks across sectors like marketing, customer support, and data analytics. 

We're going to be focused on the slice of the automated labor landscape that specifically involves robots or robotic systems over the next several classes. We'll be looking at both robotic technologies used in various sectors, and economic and cultural interpretation and commentary on a transition in some markets towards robotic technology.

To get started, we'll briefly interrogate our pre-conceptions about automated labor. [These slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NGATVhDy68OXOANkcBui68oJToIvlIScWz2fADhsaMk/edit?usp=sharing) will guide our discussion.
