* Work on project proposal

## For Next Time

* Keep working on the [final project](../assignments/final_project).

## Project Proposals

Points to keep in mind:

* Before you start diving into your project proposals, we'd recommend spending some time going over your learning goals (YOGA Phase 1).  This will help you figure out how to align the project topic and scope with individual's learning goals..
* The pre-mortem thing is a new thing we're trying this year.  I'll say a few words about it before we start.
