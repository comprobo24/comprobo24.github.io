## Computer Vision Ideation and Team Formation

Reminder: use this link to find the [computer vision project assignment documnet](../assignments/computer_vision_project).

Process:
* Review your learning goals for the class (5 min)
* Make a post-it for each of your project topics (5 min)
* Affinity grouping to cluster project topics into 6ish categories (5 min)
* Choose a group by standing by the cluster (4 min)
* Discussion of affinity cluster round 1 (15 minutes)
   - Discuss ideas but also learning goals.
   - You are not committing to a project / partner yet, but just doing some exploration
* Choose your next affinity cluster (2 min)
* Discussion of affinity cluster round 2 (15 minutes)
* Hopefully this gets you to the point where you can decide on partner + project.  If no project yet, fill out [this matching form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSbARlAlNqZvdOrjERLdyNm6sCbxtd73tCBwhJy2a03aIUHw/viewform).
