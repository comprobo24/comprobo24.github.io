## Today

* Introduction to Sustainability in Robotics
* Project Ideation, Team Formation, and Proposals

## For Next Time
* Work on the [Broader Impacts assignment Part 2](../assignments/broader_impacts), due on **November 5th at 7PM** 
  * Note -- discussions will happen on October 28th, October 31st, and November 4th; you have been [randomly assigned one of these days to lead a discussion](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t2wJVq1ryEH47zOyPqVHE0VHtDHGa2fm6ehskNi13aA/edit?usp=sharing). You may swap slots with someone on a different day, but you have to let an instructor know. Thanks!
* Read over the [Machine Vision Project Document](../assignments/computer_vision_project).
    * Project Proposal is due on **Tuesday October 22nd at 7PM**. We'll have some in-class time today to work on this.
* Consider whether there is [feedback you'd like to share about the class](https://forms.gle/giCwA1pkr4y3e4T37)

## Sustainability in Robotics
As we kickoff a new module, we'll be examining a new contextual theme: sustianability. Sustainability is commonly applied to three key "vectors" -- 
* **People / Social** -- creating well-being of people and communities 
   * Some topics include, e.g., socioeconomic equality and equity, access to resources, fair governance, education, human rights, etc.
* **Planet / Environmental** -- preserving and protecting the natural environment 
   * Some topics include, e.g., biodiveristy, air/water/soil quality, climate regulation, natural resource management, etc.
* **Products / Economic** -- enabling and preserving long-term economic well-being 
   * Some topics include, e.g., resource management, efficiency, innovation, policy and social equity, financial stability, etc.

> Discussion Question (8 minutes): How do you think robots fit into each of these vectors (either as a tool, or as an industry itself)? Do you have some examples of robots or companies that you could map to these vectors?

Throughout this module, we'll be taking a look at how machine vision is adapted into a very particular type of robotic system: waste collectors / recyclers -- 
* Automated Sorting in Recycling Plants (e.g., [rStream](https://www.rstreamrecycling.com/) and a deep dive into [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02740))
* Automated Waste Collection (e.g., [Ocean CleanUp](https://theoceancleanup.com/) and a deep dive into [papers on bespoke solutions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9501299&casa_token=-zTd-OPUEI8AAAAA:CDg94g-rOfgxdaUqO5Vj1xQ2WmszSRgbV-gr9w-_aKnRxaWu9o1MQZ3BKTDD-JojNEMtaOoRTP0))

> Discussion Question (8 minutes): In what ways do you think machine vision may be used in waste sorting / cleaning? What design characteristics would these algorithms need in order to be used in these applications? 


## Machine Vision Ideation and Team Formation
Take a look at the [machine vision project assignment document](../assignments/computer_vision_project) -- today we'll be forming teams, brainstorming project ideas, and starting your project proposals.

Process:
* [5 min] Individually review your learning goals for the class and for this project
* [5 min] Create a sticky-note for each topic/theme you'd like to explore in this project. Consider:
   * Is there a particular application of machine vision you'd like to investigate?
   * Is there a particular class of algorithm you'd like to learn about?
   * Is there a particular algorithm you'd like to implement or dataset you'd like to use?
* [5 min] Gather with 2 other folks and rapid-sort your sticky-notes into clusters on a white board -- label your clusters
* [5 min] As a class, we'll identify 6 common themes and place them around the room
* [10 min] Choose a theme that interests you and go to it in the room; with the other folks in the group, discuss your learning goals and ideas you have related to that theme
   * You're not committing to anything yet! This is about exploring some areas and project ideas of interest
* [10 min] Pick another theme and go to it; repeat your discussions
   * You're not committing to anything yet! This is about exploring some areas and project ideas of interest
* [Rest of Class Time] Find a partner and begin to scope a project you'd like to complete. You can use the proposal guidelines to frame your discussion
