This recitation provided an overview of a Factor Graph as used in modern SLAM frameworks. It drew on the following resources:

* [Factor Graphs for Navigation Applications: A Tutorial](https://navi.ion.org/content/71/3/navi.653)
* [Factor Graphs for Robot Perception](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/pub/Dellaert17fnt.pdf)
* [An Introduction to Factor Graphs](http://www.isiweb.ee.ethz.ch/papers/arch/aloe-2004-spmagffg.pdf)
    * [In Presentation Form](https://people.binf.ku.dk/~thamelry/MLSB08/hal.pdf)
* [Factor Graphs and GTSAM: A Hands-on Introduction](https://repository.gatech.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/b3606eb4-ce55-4c16-8495-767bd46f0351/content)
* [Emma Benjaminson's Blog on Factor Graphs](https://sassafras13.github.io/FactorGraphs/)

For learning more about factor graphs in a hands-on way, I highly recommend checking out [GTSAM](https://gtsam.org/) (which has a [Python API](https://github.com/gtbook/gtsam-examples/tree/main))
